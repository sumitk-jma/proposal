        <p class="the-msg">Words hai nhi Yr mere pas, I know I know miane khud ne v kaha tha labels are not needed <br>
            But honestly yr, When I thought of this I wasn't even seeking for one. <br>
            Mujhe nhi pata yr kya karna hai is <strong>YES</strong> ka, what does it mean and what it does not!! 🥹<br><br>
            You will decide it yr, tumhare liye ye kya hai!! <br>
            Do we need to take small steps forward or not?? <br><br>
            Here 's my take : I don't know how long I'm gonna live yr, no one does!! <br>
            What I want is to live the moments I have to the fullest with my loved ones be it my family or you!! <br>
            I don't have the words yr, mai nhi samjha sakta  shyd. 😅 <br>
            Simply just wanna be free enough to say the three magic words to the people I really love!! <br>
            Apart from this, not sure about anything else yr, you understand more than I do <br><br>

            Hoping FOR BEST!! Hehe 😄<br>
            Baki tum dekh lo han, apni himmat to wapas aake msg check karne ki v nhi 😅 <br><br>

            I love you Yr, I always will ❤️
